# Nafisa Nawrin Labonno
🎓 CS + Physics (Honors), University of Texas at Arlington  
💡 Interested in AI/ML, Computational Physics & Software Engineering  
🚀 Building real-world projects + doing research

I'm an aspiring software engineer & physicist with a passion for creating machine learning based solutions, web applications, and studying mathematical modeling, low-level systems design, physics, and neural networks among other things. I have recently started gaining interest in these fields, and have loved working on real-world problems ever since! I hope to keep learning constantly, bridge the gaps in reasoning and application, and seek valuable networking opportunities to grow, innovate in STEM, and make meaningful contributions to both the open-source and the wider scientific community.
